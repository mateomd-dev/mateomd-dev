title: Vision Pipeline for Self-Driving Cars
description: Vision-based pipeline for 3D reconstruction from stereo input. Components included a SLAM module and several task-specific neural networks for e.g. depth estimation and semantic segmentation. This project was a part of my dissertation and is currently being extended to an open-source framework.
